### What I learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to practice and improve my skills in HTML and CSS. I learned how to structure a web page using HTML tags. I gained a deeper understanding of how to use these tags to create a well-organized and easy-to-read page structure.


### Continued development

 I plan to expand my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS. Specifically, I would like to focus on improving my ability to structure my code in a well-organized and efficient way. I understand that creating clean and maintainable code is essential for the long-term success of a website, and I am excited to learn more about best practices in this area.
